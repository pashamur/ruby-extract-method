## Sublime Text 2 plugin: Ruby Extract Method

A lightweight plugin that creates a method from the highlighted text and saves it to your clipboard.


### Shortcut Keys

**Windows / OSX / Linux:**

 * `ALT+M` - Extract Method

#### How to perform the Extract Method refactoring in a Ruby file.
1. Select the block of code you wish to put into a method and hit the Shortcut Key (`Alt+M`)
2. Name the method
3. Hit `Enter`
4. Move your cursor to where you want to put the method, and hit `Shift+Ctrl+V` (paste with indent)

Hint: You can also redefine `Ctrl+V` as `paste_with_indent`, which will make this plugin a little more intuitive.


### Installation

You have two options, the easier of which is to install this package through Package Control.

####Package Control

2. Open the Command Palette (Command+Shift+P on OS X, Control+Shift+P on Linux/Windows).
3. Select "Package Control: Install Package"
4. Select Ruby Extract Method when the list appears.

Congratulations! The package is now installed on your system.
